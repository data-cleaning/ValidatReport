\section{Identifying validation results}
To get an idea of the (meta)data necessary to identify a validation result,
consider the data, validation rules and validation results shown in
Table~\ref{tab:example1}. When a dataset is confronted with a validation rule,
there are three possible outcomes. A rule can be satisfied, yielding \waar{}, a
rule can be failed, yielding \onwaar{}, or a rule cannot be evaluated because
of missing data, yielding \na{}.
%
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Example data, validation rules, and results}
\begin{tabular}{rccccb{4cm}}
\hline
&\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Variables}}&&\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Rules}}\\
Nr  & Age  & hasjob     && \code{Age >= 0} & \code{IF Age < 15 THEN hasjob == `no'}\\
\cline{2-3}\cline{5-6}
1   & 36   & \code{yes} && \waar{}        & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\waar{}}\\
2   & 53   & \code{NA}  && \waar{}        & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\na{}}\\
3   & 11   & \code{yes} && \waar{}        & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\onwaar{}}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:example1}
\end{table}



In the example three records on age and work status are checked against two
rules: age must be larger than or equal to zero, and persons under 15 years old
cannot have a job. In each case the demand on Â age can be checked and and each
record passes this test, yielding \waar{} as validation result. For the second
rule, the first record passes the check since age equals 36 and the person has
a job which is allowed by the rule. In the second case the job status is not
available (\na{}). Hence the rule cannot be checked and the returned value is \na{}
as well. Finally, in the third record there is an 11-year old with a job which
is a combination that is not allowed by the rule, yielding \onwaar{}.


The above discussion leads to the following definition of a validation result.
%
\begin{definition}[Validation result]
A validation result is a value from the set $\{\waar{},\onwaar{},\na{}\}$.
\label{def:validationresult}
\end{definition}
Validation results are obtained as outcomes of evaluating a validation rule on
a data set.

A recurring point of discussion is whether \na{} should be an allowed
validation result. The main other options are to either interrupt execution, or
to interpret the result as failed (\onwaar{}) when one of the data points
necessary for evaluating a rule is missing. Because statistical data often
suffers from missing data the first option would yield many interruptions of a
statistical process flow, unless each rule guards against it by building in
clauses that detect missing values explicitly. The second option (\na{} implies
\onwaar{}) would yield a loss of information. More importantly, it assumes
(possibly unwarranted) that the user of the result follows this interpretation.

We deem both alternatives undesirable and therefore follow the definition
above, which also agrees with the definition of a formal data validation
function in the Methodology on Validation handbook published by the Validat
Foundation \cite{zio2015methodology}.

\subsection{Validation events}

With a \emph{validation event} we mean the physical activity where a dataset is
confronted with a single rule, yielding precisely one validation result. A
validation event is characterized by its inputs (the rule and the dataset it
pertains to) as well as its own metadata, including the time of execution and
the actor performing the execution. We therefore adopt the following convention
by defining a set of keys that identifies such a physical event.
%
\begin{definition}[validation event] 
A validation event is a triple $(e,r,d)$, where $e$ identifies metadata of the
physical event, $r$ identifies the evaluated validation rule and $d$ identifies
the data points involved in the evaluation.
\label{def:validaitonevent}
\end{definition}
%
We leave open the possibility that each component $e$, $r$ and $d$ consists of
informative tuples to identify subcomponents of the event, data or rule.  Note
that the above `definition' is not a definition in the mathematical sense.
Rather it is a convention that can be tested in a (software) environment where
data, rules, and validation events have been labeled and stored.

 
\section{Basic validation reports}
The concepts of a validation result and a validation event now allow us to 
give a recursive definition of a validation report.
%
\begin{definition}[Basic validation report]\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
\item The empty set $\{\}$ is a basic validation report.
\item If $\la{k}$ is a validation event and $v$ its validation result, then $\{(\la{k},v)\}$
is a basic validation report.
\item If $V$ and $W$ are basic validation reports, then the set union $V\cup
W$, set difference $V-W$ and set intersection $V\cap W$ are validation reports.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
%
It follows trivially that any subset of a basic validation report is a
basic validation report. The event key $\la{k}$ ensures identifiability of the
validation result $v$ for each element of a report (Demand~\ref{dem:identify}),
while the set union ensures that reports can be combined
(Demand~\ref{dem:combine}).


\subsection{Structure of a basic validation report}
Below, we detail the minimum information to include in each slot of a formal 
validation event. Every table has four columns, with the following contents.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item: the name of the slot.
\item Format: technical format of the data in the slot. Allowed formats are: \code{string},
\code{numeric}, \code{enum} (with categories defined in the description column), \code{datetime} and
\code{-}. The latter indicates that the format is free, including the possibility to include user-defined objects.
\item Description: a short description of the slot. More detailed descriptions
might follow after the table.
\item Example: an example.
\end{enumerate}
%
The information in these Tables is mandatory. For each table it is also
indicated whether it is allowed to extend it with user-defined information.


The different data types are to be formatted according to commonly used
standards where possible. In particular, data in validation reports shall be
encoded as stated in Table~\ref{tab:dataformat}.
\begin{center}
\captionof{table}{Format of data types in validation reports (basic or extended).}
\begin{tabular}{|lp{0.92\textwidth}|}
\hline
1&Numbers shall be encoded in a valid decimal ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (IEEE 754) format \\
2&Date-time data shall be denoted in ISO 8601 format \code{YYMMDDTHHmmss+HHMM}. \\
3&Enumerated data types are encoded as a string from the set predefined in the item's description.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:dataformat}
\end{center}

The following Tables fix the information content of each item making up elements of 
a validation report: $e$, $r$, $d$, and $v$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Identification of the validated data}
Although generic models for identifying a data point exist [e.g.
\citet[Chapter~5]{zio2015methodology}], it will in practice often depend on the
local implementation of a local data model. Therefore, little limits are posed
on the keys involved in pointing out the data used in an evaluation. However,
as a general rule, it should be clear 
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
\item to which population the data under scrutiny pertains;
\item the identity of the process that yielded the data (`time of measurement');
\item to which units in the population the data pertains;
\item what variables are measured by the data.
\end{itemize}
These are the four components defined in the Methodology of validation handbook 
\citep{zio2015methodology}.


\begin{center}
\captionof{table}{Mandatory identification of validated data $d$.}
\begin{tabular}{|lp{15mm}p{0.34\textwidth}p{0.34\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{Item} & \textbf{Format} & \textbf{Description} &\textbf{Example}\\
data    &\multicolumn{1}{c}{-} & A set of key(s) or other identification (e.g.
a query statement) identifying the data used in evaluating the validation rule
&  (`people in NL', `SILC2016, `Ria Respondent', `Income')\\
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{|l|}{The number of slots defining a validation rule is \textbf{extendable}.
}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Allowing for implicit definition of the (sub)set of data touched by a
validation rule potentially reduces the size of a validation report
significantly: it is possible to have millions of datapoints involved in a
single validation rule. The trade-off is that aggregating validation reports,
grouped by properties of the data directly is not possible.

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.97\textwidth}|}
\hline
It is recommended that for validation rules that can be evaluated using a
single datapoint only (e.g. \code{income >= 0}), the data is identified using a
key (or array of keys) directly related to the data value under scrutiny.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Aggregation}
In the context of validation, commonly reported aggregates include the total
number or fraction of rules violated or the number or fraction of records  that
violate a certain rule. The latter aggregates may be reported for the whole
population or for each relevant subpopulations (e.g. by economic activity for a
business survey). 


Before discussing how we endow machine-readable validation reports with
identifiable and combinable aggregates, it is usefull to point out some of the
subtleties that arise when thinking of aggregation is a generaly way. The first
subtlety has to do with counting rules and counting validation results.
Consider as an example the rules \code{turnover >= 0} and \code{mean(profit) >=
0}.  When applied to a set of $n$ business records containing the variables
\code{turnover} and \code{profit}, the first rule is evaluated $n$ times in $n$
validation events, yielding $n$ validation results. The second rule is
evaluated in a single validation event, yielding a single validation result,
regardless of the number of records in the dataset. This means that an
aggregate such as `the total number of rules violated' is ill-defined. It is
only meaningfull to talk about `the number of events that resulted in
\onwaar{}'. 

The second subtlety is that a set of aggregates can again be combined to form
new aggregates. For example, in a first step we may compute the fraction of
events yielding \onwaar{} per economic sector. In a next step we count for how
many sectors this number is less than or equal to 0.05.

Figure~\ref{fig:graphs} illustrates the above points in a graph-like structure.
Suppose we start with a basic report containing five validation results. We can
add an aggregate counting the number of passes in a certain subset
(Figure~\ref{fig:graph1}).  In Figure~\ref{fig:graph2}, a second count is
added, as well as an overall count that is composed of the two low-level
aggregates. Figure~\ref{fig:graph3} depics a situation where a subset of
valdation results are combined to form aggregates of several types: the number
of passes and the fraction of passes.

\end{figure}

These examples suggest that aggregates can be interpreted as nodes in a
directed graph where the edges (arrows) point from the aggregate to the nodes
used to compute the contents of the node. Nodes that have no outgoing edges
correspond one-to-one with validation results---they can be considered a
trivial aggregate. The collection of nodes and edges contain sufficient
structure to make the representation of validaiton reports identifiable,
combinable, and (recursively) aggregable. We now proceed to 



\subsection{Graph structure}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{simple finite directed graph} is a pair  $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a finite set and $E$
is a set of pairs $(v_1,v_2)$ with $v_1,v_2\in V$ and $v_1\not=v_2$.
\end{definition}
The elements of $V$ are usully called \emph{nodes} or \emph{vertices} and the
elements of $E$ are usually called \emph{edges} or \emph{arrows}. A validation
report can be represented by a more special graph. Since aggregation works
bottom-up and not top-down, we define the following.
\begin{definition}
An \emph{oriented graph} is a simple finite directed graph $(V,E)$ where for any
$v_1$ and $v_2$ in $V$ at most one of $(v_1,v_2)$ and $(v_2,v_1)$ are in $E$.
\end{definition}
Graphs, and in particular oriented graphs, can be combined naturally to form
new graphs. Namely, if $G=(V,E)$ and $F=(V',E')$ are oriented graphs then
\begin{equation}
G\oplus F = (V\cup V', E\cup E').
\end{equation}
is also an oriented graph.










%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Extended validation report structure}
Conceptually, the structure of an extended validation report is an oriented
graph, where each node is either atomic (resulting from a validation event) or
an aggregate, possibly built from previous aggregate. The atomic nodes store
information on the used validation function, the data involved and the event
that created it. The aggregated nodes store information on the agregating
function (sum, mean, $\ldots$), while the edges indicate which nodes were used
to form an aggregate. Formally, the definition can  now be written as follows.
%
\begin{definition}[Extended validation report]\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}
\item The empty graph $(\{\},\{\})$ is an extended validation report.
\item If $B$ is a basic validation report, then the edgeless graph $(B, \{\})$
is an extended validation report.
\item Given an extended validation report $(V,E)$  a subset $S\subseteq V$ and
a function $f:2^V\to\mathbb{R}$.  Denoting the aggregate node $a=(f,f(S))$, then 
\begin{displaymath}
\left(
V\cup \{a\}, E\cup \bigcup_{s\in S}\left\{( a, s )\right\}
\right)
\end{displaymath}
is an extended validation report.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Here, the first step is a formality, allowing one to apply formal set
operations on the elements of a validation report. In the second step a basic
validation report is lifted to an extended validation report by endowing it
with an empty set of edges. The crucial step is step three. Here, an aggregate
function is assumed that assigns a number to a set of nodes of an extended
validation report. The number and the aggregating function are paired and added
as a node to the existing node set. Furthermore, the set of edges is extended
with pairs $(a,s)$ where $a$ is the aggregate node and $s$ runs over all nodes
that were used to compute the aggregate.
